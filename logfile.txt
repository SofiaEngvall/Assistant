A: When importing the package, Python searches through the directories on sys.
A: path looking for the package subdirectory.
A: The__init__.
b'A: py \xef\xac\x81les are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path.'
A: In the simplest case, __init__.
b'A: py can just be an empty \xef\xac\x81le, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.'
A: Users of the package can import individual modules from the package, for example: import sound.
A: effects.
A: echo This loads the submodule sound.
A: effects.
A: echo.
A: It must be referenced with its full name.
A: sound.
A: effects.
A: echo.
A: echofilter( input, output, delay =0.
A: 7, atten=4) An alternative way of importing the submodule is: from sound.
b'A: effects importecho This also loads the submodule echo, and makes it available without its package pre\xef\xac\x81x, so it can be used as follows: echo.'
A: echofilter( input, output, delay =0.
A: 7, atten=4) Yet another variation is to import the desired function or variable directly: from sound.
A: effects.
A: echo importechofilter Again, this loads the submodule echo, but this makes its function echofilter() directly available: echofilter( input, output, delay =0.
b'A: 7, atten=4) Note that when using from package import item , the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name de\xef\xac\x81ned in the package, like a function, class or variable.'
b'A: The import statement \xef\xac\x81rst tests whether the item is de\xef\xac\x81ned in the package; if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts to load it.'
b'A: If it fails to \xef\xac\x81nd it, an ImportError exception is raised.'
A: Contrarily, when using syntax like import item.
A: subitem.
b'A: subsubitem , each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can\xe2\x80\x99t be a class or function or variable de\xef\xac\x81ned 6.'

A: Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0 30 Chapter 4.
A: More Control Flow Tools.
A: CHAPTER FIVE DATA STRUCTURES This chapter describes some things you�ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well.
A: 5.1More on Lists The list data type has some more methods.
A: Here are all of the methods of list objects: list.
A: append(x) Add an item to the end of the list.
A: Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].
A: list.
A: extend(iterable) Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable.
A: Equivalent to a[len(a):] = iterable.
A: list.
A: insert(i,x) Insert an item at a given position.
b'A: The \xef\xac\x81rst argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).'
A: list.
b'A: remove(x) Remove the \xef\xac\x81rst item from the list whose value is equal to x.'
A: It raises a ValueError if there is no such item.
A: list.
A: pop([i]) Removetheitematthegivenpositioninthelist, andreturnit.
b'A: Ifnoindexisspeci\xef\xac\x81ed, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list.'
A: (The square brackets around the iin the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you should type square brackets at that position.
A: You will see this notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.) list.
A: clear() Remove all items from the list.
A: Equivalent to del a[:].
A: list.
b'A: index(x[,start [,end ] ]) Return zero-based index in the list of the \xef\xac\x81rst item whose value is equal to x.'
A: Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.
A: The optional arguments startand endare interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list.
A: The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the startargument.
A: list.
A: count(x) Return the number of times xappears in the list.
A: list.
A: sort(key=None ,reverse=F alse ) Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see sorted() for their explanation).
A: 31.
A: Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0 list.
A: reverse() Reverse the elements of the list in place.
A: list.
A: copy() Return a shallow copy of the list.
A: Equivalent to a[:].
A: An example that uses most of the list methods: >>>fruits=['orange','apple','pear','banana','kiwi','apple','banana'] >>>fruits.count('apple') 2 >>>fruits.count('tangerine ') 0 >>>fruits.index('banana') 3 >>>fruits.index('banana',4)# Find next banana starting a position 4 6 >>>fruits.reverse() >>>fruits ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange'] >>>fruits.append('grape') >>>fruits ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape'] >>>fruits.sort() >>>fruits ['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'pear'] >>>fruits.pop() 'pear' You might have noticed that methods like insert,removeorsortthat only modify the list have no return value printed � they return the default None.1This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in Python.
b'A: 5.1.1Using Lists as Stacks The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the \xef\xac\x81rst element retrieved (\xe2\x80\x9clast-in, \xef\xac\x81rst-out\xe2\x80\x9d).'
A: To add an item to the top of the stack, use append().
A: To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop()without an explicit index.
A: For example: >>>stack=[3,4,5] >>>stack.append(6) >>>stack.append(7) >>>stack [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] >>>stack.pop() 7 >>>stack [3, 4, 5, 6] >>>stack.pop() 6 >>>stack.pop() 5 >>>stack [3, 4] 1Other languages may return the mutated object, which allows method chaining, such as d->insert("a")->remove("b")->sort();.
A: 32 Chapter 5.
A: Data Structures.
b'A: Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0 5.1.2Using Lists as Queues It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the \xef\xac\x81rst element added is the \xef\xac\x81rst element retrieved (\xe2\x80\x9c\xef\xac\x81rst-in, \xef\xac\x81rst-out\xe2\x80\x9d); however, lists are not e\xef\xac\x83cient for this purpose.'

A: Setting Up Your Python�Environment ���5If you get an error or a version of Python 2, make sure you followed all the preceding steps and that you have the up-to-date version of Kali.
A: Keep in mind that for most examples throughout this book, you can develop your code in a variety of environments, including macOS, Linux, and Windows.
A: You may also want to set up a different virtual environment for separate projects or chapters.
A: Some chapters are Windows specific, which we�ll make sure to mention at the beginning of the chapter.
A: Now that we have our hacking virtual machine and a Python 3 virtual environment set up, let�s install a Python IDE for development.
A: Installing an IDE An integrated development environment (IDE)  provides a set of tools for coding.
A: Typically, it includes a code editor, with syntax highlighting and automatic linting, and a debugger.
A: The purpose of the IDE is to make it easier to code and debug your programs.
A: You don�t have to use one to program in Python; for small test programs, you might use any text editor (such as vim, nano, Notepad, or emacs).
A: But for larger, more complex project, an IDE will be of enormous help to you, whether by indicating variables you have defined but not used, finding misspelled variable names, or locating missing package imports.
A: In a recent Python developer survey, the top two favorite IDEs were PyCharm (which has commercial and free versions available) and Visual Studio Code (free).
A: Justin is a fan of WingIDE (commercial and free versions available), and Tim uses Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
A: All three IDEs can be used on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
A: You can install PyCharm from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/  or WingIDE from https://wingware.com/downloads/.
